# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: I am the Quantum Lead Research Scientist at the NCSA, UIUC. My research activities focus on on understanding complex systems at multiple scales through theory, modeling and computation. I make use ofstatistical physics, quantum computing and agent-based modeling as the core tools used to reveal unexpected properties of systems. I am interested in the application of this theoretical and computational toolbox to global risks and security.
