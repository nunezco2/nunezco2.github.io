**CITQCA** focuses on *understanding*, *designing* and *intervening* on systems that are reallistically complex by applying theory and computation commensurate with the challenge at hand. We seek to develop next-generation methods and tools that extend our ability to reason about hard problems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and different disciplines.

### Methods

* Higher algebra: category theory, topos theory, homotopy type theory (HoTT)
* Stochastic methods: stochastic processes, stochastic differential equations
* Statistical physics: 
* Tensor calculus and geometric algebra:
* Hilbert spaces: properties

### Tools

* Quantum computing
* Agent-based modeling

### Applications

* Quantum device digital twins
* Quantum computer architecture
* High-level quantum programming language design
* New quantum algorithms applications
* Global security challenges

### Connections

* [Visual Analytics](https://www.visualanalytics.ncsa.illinois.edu/), NCSA - UIUC
* [Illinois Quantum Science and Technology Center (IQUIST)](https://iquist.illinois.edu), UIUC
