**CITQCA** focuses on *understanding*, *designing* and *intervening* in systems that are reallistically complex by applying theory and computation commensurate with the challenge at hand. We seek to develop next-generation methods and tools that extend our ability to reason about hard problems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and different disciplines.

### Methods

* Higher algebra
* Stochastic methods
* Statistical physics
* Tensor calculus and geometric algebra
* High-level quantum programming language design

### Tools

* Quantum computing
* Agent-based modeling
* Digital twins for quantum devices
* Quantum computer architecture

### Applications

* New quantum algorithms for biomedicine
* Global security challenges
* Understanding Intelligence writ large

### Connections

* [Visual Analytics](https://www.visualanalytics.ncsa.illinois.edu/), NCSA - UIUC
* [Illinois Quantum Science and Technology Center (IQUIST)](https://iquist.illinois.edu), UIUC
